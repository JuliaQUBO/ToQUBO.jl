# Logo

The ideia behind [ToQUBO](../../..)'s logo comes from a wordplay in Portuguese. The package's main purpose is to assemble QUBO Models, which sounds like *cubo*[¹](#1), portuguese for cube.

[![ToQUBO.jl](./logo.svg)](.)

## Colors

The colors were chosen according to  *Julia's Reference for logo graphics*[²](#2). Text color matches the innermost shape and renders fairly well in both light and dark background themes.

## Typography
*MADETYPE Sunflower*[³](#3) Font was used. It was converted to a SVG path through the *Google Font to Svg Path*[⁴](#4) online tool.
