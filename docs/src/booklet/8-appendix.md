## ToQUBO.jl's Assets

### Logo

The ideia behind [ToQUBO.jl](https://github.com/psrenergy/ToQUBO.jl)'s logo comes from a wordplay in Portuguese and Spanish.
The package's main purpose is to assemble QUBO Models, which sounds like *cubo*[^1], the translation for *cube*.

### Colors

The colors were picked according to  *Julia's Reference for logo graphics*[^2].
Text color matches the innermost shape and renders fairly well in both light and dark background themes.

### Typography

The *MADETYPE Sunflower*[^3] font was chosen.
It was converted to a SVG path using the *Google Font to Svg Path*[^4] online tool.

### Web Icon ![ToQUBO.jl Icon](../assets/favicon.ico)

The icon used to decorate the documentation resembles an assembled version of the cube with its blue face making up the background.
